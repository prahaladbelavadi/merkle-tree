# merkle-tree
nodejs implementation of a merkle tree

This walks you through how merkle trees are created
There's probably another smarter, better, non repetitive way to generate data to be hashed into the tree.

Merkle proofs could be added in sometime later.

> update: sha256 is deprecated, use [crypto library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js) since it's recommended by [official nodejs ______](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html).

Plus [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sha256) has just sha256 which is among many cryptographic one way hash functions there exist, the crypto library has a lot more.

Cheers!
